[City Inspector](https://cityinspector.herokuapp.com/login) is a one page web application that displays quality of life ratings for potential cities that you would want to live in, as well as expected salary range based on job title. 

This was a one-day solo challenge to explore using APIs and create an application from scratch. Full details of the challenge are below:

### Build Something Beautiful & Meaningful

#### Learning Competencies
  * Building a web application from scratch
  * Managing the development process

#### Summary
You should work by yourself.

You've learned a lot in phase 2: Sinatra, Active Record, JavaScript, Agile, and much more. Each of these tools is useful in its own right, but together, they give you something much more powerful â€” the ability to build a web application from nothing.

For this challenge, your assignment is to build something. It can be as practical or trivial as you would want, as long as it is a 100% functional, full-stack web application.

You can build anything you want, provided that it meets the following requirements:

- It has a database
- Construct a controller that has at least 1 RESTful resource
- It uses an API (what does this mean?! explore!)
- It is styled
- It utilizes JavaScript
- It is deployed to Heroku

Once you've come up with an idea, get one of your teachers to approve it.
